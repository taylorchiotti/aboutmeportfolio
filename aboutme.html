                <p>I’m Taylor Chiotti. A UX/UI designer. I recently completed my user experience bootcamp, but my junior status doesn’t discount the breadth of knowledge I’ve accumulated. I have skills in Figma, (in progress), (in progress), (in progress). Alongside these technical skills, I am adept in interviewing, identifying user needs, and UI. A more comprehensive list of skills can be viewed below in my resume or to see a complete walkthrough of my design process please view a project under my work.</p>
                <p>I completed my bootcamp with the University of Oregon. In 6 months the curriculum prepared me for the ever-changing needs and fast pace of the design world. We completed 4 large design projects, 3 of these being group projects. Honing not only my individual design skills, but the ability to create successful products with a team were notable takeaways from the course.</p>
                <p>In my designs I value balance and clarity. We are constantly bombarded by an overload of visual information when we enter digital spaces. I aim to create an interface where the user can move through the space fluidly and with a sense of joy. This is my goal in every project.</p>
